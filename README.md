1. ### What are the differences between var, let, and const in JavaScript?

   1. **var:**

      **Scope:** Function-scoped. Variables declared with `var` are accessible within the function they are declared in.

      **Hoisting:** `var` declarations are hoisted to the top of their scope and initialized with `undefined`.

      **Re-declaration:** Allowed within the same scope.

      ```javascript
      function example() {
        console.log(x); // undefined due to hoisting
        var x = 5;
        console.log(x); // 5
      }
      example();
      ```

   2. **let:**

      **Scope:** Block-scoped. Accessible only within the block (`{}`) they are declared in.

      **Hoisting:** `let` declarations are hoisted but not initialized. Accessing them before declaration results in a `ReferenceError`.

      **Re-declaration:** Not allowed within the same scope.

      ```javascript
      {
        console.log(y); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'y' before initialization
        let y = 10;
        console.log(y); // 10
      }
      ```

   3. **const:**

      **Scope:** Block-scoped.

      **Hoisting:** Similar to `let`, `const` declarations are hoisted but not initialized. Accessing them before declaration results in a `ReferenceError`.

      **Re-declaration:** Not allowed within the same scope.

      **Assignment:** Must be initialized at the time of declaration and cannot be reassigned.

      ```javascript
      {
        const z = 15;
        z = 20; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
      }
      ```

2. ### How does variable hoisting work in JavaScript wrt var, let, const?

    Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top of their scope before code execution.

     1. **var:** Declarations are hoisted and initialized with undefined.
   
      ```javascript
      console.log(a); // undefined
      var a = 3;

      // it is interpreted as

      var a;
      console.log(a); // undefined
      a = 3;
      ```
     2. **let and const:**  Declarations are hoisted but not initialized. Accessing them before declaration results in a `ReferenceError`.

      ```javascript
      console.log(b); // ReferenceError
      let b = 5;
      ```
